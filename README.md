This project is split into two parts. 

1. Data engineering: I created a script to parse and condense the chess games available in the lichess database: https://database.lichess.org/
The games that are included in the analysis are only those that have an evaluation available (around 6% of the games according to the lichess documentation).

2. Data analysis: Naturally I could not help myself and I went and analysed the wonderful dataset that was created in step 1 to see whether I could get insights about the playing habbits of chess masters broken down by theri rating.
